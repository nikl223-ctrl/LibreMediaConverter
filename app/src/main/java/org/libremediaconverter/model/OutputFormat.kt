/**
 * Container families.
 *
 * Each entry owns the three things that used to be duplicated per preset: the FFmpeg muxer name,
 * the file extension, and the MIME type handed to the SAF `CreateDocument` contract. Keeping them
 * here is what makes an open container × codec matrix possible — a preset no longer has to exist
 * for every combination someone might want.
 *
 * Extension and MIME type depend on whether a video track survives: Matroska with video is `.mkv`
 * and without it `.mka`, MP4 is `.mp4` or `.m4a`. That distinction is why they are functions rather
 * than properties.
 *
 * The extension turned out to depend on a second thing, which is what [audioCodecExtensions] is
 * for — see its parameter note.
 *
 * @param ffmpegFormat the `-f` value. Named explicitly rather than left to extension inference,
 *   which is unreliable for MPEG-TS and ASF.
 * @param audioCodecExtensions per-codec overrides of [audioExtension]. Ogg is the only container
 *   that needs one, and it is the reason this parameter exists: one Ogg stream can hold Vorbis,
 *   Opus or FLAC, and RFC 7845 §9 asks for `.opus` on an Ogg that carries Opus alone while
 *   everything else in an Ogg is a plain `.ogg`. A single container-wide extension cannot say
 *   both — and it said `opus` for *every* Ogg until [OutputFormat.OGG_VORBIS] existed, which
 *   would have named a Vorbis file `.opus`. That is the same defect as the `FLAC` preset that
 *   once declared Matroska with a `.flac` extension, which is what moved these fields onto the
 *   container in the first place.
