/**
 * Chooses the engine for a conversion.

 * Media3 Transformer is preferred wherever it is capable, because it is hardware
 * accelerated end to end (MediaCodec decode -> GL surface -> MediaCodec encode) and
 * runs several times faster than software encoding at a fraction of the battery cost.
 * FFmpeg handles everything Media3 structurally cannot.
 *
 * The rules below are capability boundaries, not preferences. Each one exists because
 * Media3 would fail or silently produce the wrong thing.
 *
 * ## Every rule asks the plan, not the request
 *
 * [CopyPlanner] resolves [VideoCodec.COPY] into a concrete per-track decision *before* any rule
 * runs, and each rule below consults that plan rather than the user's raw choice. The ordering is
 * load-bearing: `COPY` belongs to none of the capability sets, so a rule that tested the request
 * directly would send every remux to FFmpeg on the first check and Media3's transmux path would
 * never run. Worse, nothing would notice — FFmpeg's `-c copy` produces a perfectly correct file,
 * just more slowly and on the CPU.
