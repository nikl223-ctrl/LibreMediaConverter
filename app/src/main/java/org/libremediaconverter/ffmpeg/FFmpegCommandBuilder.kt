     *
     * These are the exact flags the arm carried before #254, and the arm had never run: `VORBIS`
     * was absent from `ContainerCapabilities.ENCODABLE_AUDIO` and no `OutputFormat` offered it.
     * It could not have run either. `--enable-libvorbis` was not in the AAR's configure line, and
     * `strings` on the shipped `libavcodec.so` named `libx264`, `libx265`, `libvpx`, `libmp3lame`,
     * `libopus`, `libdav1d`, `libsvtav1` and `libjxl` — no `libvorbis`. The first user to pick Ogg
     * Vorbis would have got "Unknown encoder 'libvorbis'". #254 rebuilt the AAR with
     * `--enable-libvorbis` (`bin/README.md` carries the new configure line and checksum) and made
     * the arm reachable. The flags did not have to change; the binary under them did.
     *
     * **Nothing on the JVM can tell a real encoder name from a fictional one**, which is exactly
     * how that survived four coverage waves. `FFmpegCommandBuilderTest` can only pin that this is
     * what the builder emits. That `libvorbis` is really in there is proved by `FFmpegEngineTest`'s
     * `encodesOggVorbisThroughAnEncoderTheBundledBinaryActuallyHas`, on a device, and by nothing
     * else in this repo.
     *
     * Two flags are deliberately *absent*, and both would be forced by FFmpeg's in-tree `vorbis`
     * encoder — the one the binary already had, and the one a first pass at #254 used:
     *
     *  - **no `-strict experimental`**. The in-tree encoder carries `AV_CODEC_CAP_EXPERIMENTAL`
     *    and libavcodec refuses it without the flag. libvorbis is not experimental.
     *  - **no `-ac 2`**. The in-tree encoder is stereo-only — *"Current FFmpeg Vorbis encoder only
     *    supports 2 channels."* — so it would silently upmix a mono source and downmix a surround
     *    one, a compromise this app makes nowhere else. libvorbis takes any channel count, so mono
     *    stays mono — the e2e test's fixture is mono and it asserts the output still is.
     *
     * `-q:a 5` is libvorbis's classic ~160 kbps setting, and the scale behind it is the third
     * reason for the rebuild. Over one 3 s clip libvorbis spans 10931..64166 bytes across q0..q10
     * where the in-tree encoder spans 7549..14645 — so libvorbis at this setting (16429 bytes)
     * already writes more than the in-tree encoder can at q10, and the knob has somewhere to go
     * if this app ever exposes it.
