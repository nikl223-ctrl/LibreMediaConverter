 * What the screen should show, given what WorkManager last said about the job.

 * ## Why this is a function rather than the body of a `collect`
 *
 * It was the body of one. `workManager` is built in the constructor from `WorkManager.getInstance`,
 * `observe` is private, and nothing could hand either a chosen `WorkInfo` — so every arm below ran
 * only when a real worker happened to produce it. A real worker produces a terminal state with
 * well-formed output, which meant six of these arms had never been chosen by any test: the progress
 * read, both sides of the retry check, a success with no file, a failure with nothing to say, and
 * the two that map to a state the user cannot otherwise reach.
 *
 * That is the argument #141 made for `MediaProbe`'s track walk, against `WorkManager` instead of a
 * media fixture, and it takes the same answer: the branch matrix is a pure function, and what is
 * left needing the framework — the flow, the null check, the ownership check — is the thin edge.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* in here
 *
 * The ownership check stays at the call site. Its comment is explicit that it guards the file
 * ownership the `SUCCEEDED` arm takes, not merely the assignment, so moving it inside would change
 * what it protects. And this function takes no responsibility for the staged file: it returns the
 * state, and the caller reads the file off it. A pure function that deletes files is not a seam.
 *
 * @param cancelled where a cancellation lands, which differs for a reattached job — see [observe].
 * @param fallbackSpec the current settings, read only when finished work predates the worker
 *   reporting its own name and MIME type.
